  This orb enables users to check the health of a specific AWS region for any issues. If there are issues
  detected, the aws-health/health-check command waits for the issue to be resolved before continuing on to
  next steps in the job. If the issue is not resolved before the maximum check attempts have been reached,
  the job will fail. This is especially useful during deployments. The AWS Healh Orb can help prevent
  deployments to an AWS region with known issues.
