  This example demonstrates the usage of the aws-health/check_health command to check for issues before
  updating an ECS service. If aws-health/check_health command detects issues, the command fails and prevents
  the aws-ecs/update-service command from deploying a service to a region that's unavailable.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    aws-health: circleci/aws-health@1.0
    aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@3.1
    aws-ecs: circleci/aws-ecs@3.2
  job:
    check_health-and-deploy:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:current
      steps:
        # Check health of us-west-1 region before updating ecs service
        - aws-cli/setup:
            profile: "OIDC-USER"
            role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/VALID_OIDC_CODEDEPLOY_ROLE"
        - aws-health/check_health:
            profile: "OIDC-USER"
            aws_region_to_check: "us-west-1"
            max_poll_attempts: 10
        # This command only runs if the above command does not detect issues
        - aws-ecs/update-service:
            family: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-service'
            cluster: '${MY_APP_PREFIX}-cluster'
  workflows:
    update-service:
      jobs:
        - check_health-and-deploy:
