  This example demonstrates the usage of the aws-health/check_health job to check for issues before
  deploying an ECS service update. If aws-health/check_health job detects issues, the job fails and prevents
  the aws-ecs/deploy-service-update job from deploying a service update to the region that's unavailable.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    aws-health: circleci/aws-health@1.0
    aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@4.0
    aws-ecs: circleci/aws-ecs@4.0

        - aws-ecs/deploy-service-update:
            # By requiring the job above, this job only runs if aws-health/check_health job passes
